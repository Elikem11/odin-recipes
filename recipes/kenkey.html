    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kenkey is a typical Ghanaian dish made from fermented white corn which is widely
    consumed throughout the country. It is believed to have originated by Ga people 
    from southern Ghana or Accra.</p>
    <p>The Ga tribe calls it 'Komi' and the Fantes call it 'Dokono'. Kenkey is often
     accompanied by fried fish throughout West Africa where fishing is widely practiced
     and where fish are generally eaten fresh and fried or dried or smoked for better preservation</p>
